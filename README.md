Si4703_FMRadio
==============

Si4703 w/ RDS library and example
Using the code to hopefully read and display RDS/RBDS signal generated from the Capristo exhaust unit on an Audi R8 V10, as the FM display on the stock radio is unable to continually display which mode your in. Will still need to find a suitable OLED display for the unit.
If I'm successful in implementing the display I may try to integrate more info for the R8's G-forces, etc.Why
